Add with app.app_context(): above db = SQLAlchemy(app) like this:

with app.app_context():
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

and when using the commands do this:

python
>>> from app import app, db
>>> app.app_context().push()
>>> db.create_all()

This will create the database in a folder called instance. After that everything just works fine. :)
